\chapter {Introduction}

Extensions are used to add capabilities to existing software.

IPC (Inter-Process Communication) techniques used by a process-based extension
to communicate with its host back and forth can be costly.

Thread-driven extensions within the host process can be driven by a thread
pool, potentially reducing the number of context switches significantly.

Processes NOT FAST ENOUGH.

TODO: Mention that the extensions are C/C++, running native code.
