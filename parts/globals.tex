\chapter {Eliminating Globals}

Naturally, globals can't be shared directly when every piece of memory is owned
by a process.

\section {Read-Only?}

Loads not modified => globals can be shared. They're still write-protected from
instructions writing to memory.

\section {Global Inits}

blah blah problems with int foo = getch() in C++. Not allowed in C, so in C
there's no problem.

Can also disallow global\_ctors.

Can also say they're not allowed to access external function calls. This way
they can only be assigned data based on the struct. Modify init-calls as well
to use thread-local struct.

\section {Thread-Pool Problems}

Yay. :(
