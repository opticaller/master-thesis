\chapter {Implementation Outline}

We propose a solution to sandboxing plugin instances individually. This is in
accordance with the project provider's policy for multiple plugin instances.
This actually complicates the process, as global variables in code can no
longer be shared between plugin instances, as they're not allowed to access
them themselves.

On purpose the following chapters describe variations on specific issues and
when they can be used. Combinations of different solutions to sub-problems can
be used for effectively determining a policy for how plugins are allowed to
behave.

In the more complex case of thread-pool driven tasks, where there's not a
one-to-one mapping between threads and plugin instances some issues arise. We
will discuss some of these issues in the following chapters as well.

Finally, we'd like to emphasize that determining which configuration to use is
highly dependant factors such as the purpose of sandboxing for the particular
program, performance requirements and the mapping between threads and plugin
instances; there's no one-size fits all.
