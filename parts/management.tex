\chapter {Plugin Management}

Ideally a plugin should shut down gracefully when misbehaving. Allocated
resources, such as memory or file descriptors, should be deallocated or closed.

\section {Signal Handling}

Signals indicating errors should cause a plugin to shut down, and indicate to
the managing thread that this occurred. The main thread can then free resources
associated with the plug-in.
