\chapter {Code Instrumentation}

Blah blah opt pass.

\section {Function Pointers}

Arbitrary function calls could potentially be done using function pointers. If
an extension could figure out where a piece of code resides

\section {Assembly Code}

Arbitrary code etc. Non-portable. Run arbitrary code. Maybe figure out where
some dynamically-loaded functions reside and call those directly. System calls
are often implemented through interrupts. 

Functionality which should be optimized using assembly code on select platforms
can be abstracted and placed in an API call and be implemented per-platform by
the host. Similar to intrinsic functions in GCC to provide SIMD instructions
without using assembly code. The host implementation can then provide an
optimized implementation on platforms where specific SIMD instructions are
available, but also a provide portable version when they are not.
